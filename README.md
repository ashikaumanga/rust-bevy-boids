# Bevy Boids


This project demonstrates the Boids algorithm, a simulation of flocking behavior, implemented in Rust using the Bevy game engine. The Boids algorithm models the behavior of birds, fish, or other entities that move in flocks.  

It also incorporates ray-cast-based obstacle avoidance using functionalities of the Rapier physics engine.

egui is used to implement UI menus.
